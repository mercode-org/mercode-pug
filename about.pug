          | Mercode is not an enterpreneurship, company or a brand and is very strict about your privacy and rights. Mercode&rsquo;s cause is to dominate the world with decentralised internet friendly open source products and people using them in order to crush the monopoly of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and many others. The Mercode team keeps working for achieving this cause of humanity.

          | Mercode and its subprojects are existing thanks to the donations of our users and team members. So the progression of Mercode is in the hands of the community. If you would like to see this team contributing more to the community, you can donate us on Patreon to help us paying our server bills or to order us a coffee (because we need it after long hours of coding). If Mercode wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep contributing, *they* will win.
