        p(style='font-size: 14px;')
          | Mercode and its subprojects are existing thanks to the donations of our users and team members. So the progression of Mercode is in the hands of the community. If you would like to see this team contributing more to the community, you can donate us on Patreon to help us paying our server bills or to order us a coffee (because we need it after long hours of coding). If Mercode wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep contributing, *they* will win.
